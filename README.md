## D2R-Mod-Pack-MULTI-13
**D2R Mod-Pack v3 [MULTI-13] (all Languages should be supported now)**

I merged and translated some useful mods into one.
They are packed into a folder not as MPQ file and without the need to unpack game files.
Also this way mods can be added/deleted pretty easy.


## ***How to install:***

- Unpack "mods" folder to your D2R folder.
- Create shortcut from D2R.exe and add in target line: -mod expanded
- If the game starts with new game settings and no character at first startup means the mod is working.

For ZLOEmu (ZClient): Drop the shortcut on the ZClient window after login.

New savegame location is the "mods/expanded" folder in your normal save directory for D2R
- "C:/Users/Username/Saved Games/D2R/mods/expanded"
